# Issues Fixed - ScanStock Project

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 1. Database Migration Warning
**Issue**: Warning about recreating users table in App.tsx
**Fix**: 
- Removed `recreateUsersTable` import and call from App.tsx
- Simplified database initialization
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED

### 2. Dual Database System
**Issue**: App had both SQLite and Supabase implementations causing confusion
**Fix**:
- Removed `react-native-sqlite-storage` package
- Backed up `src/database/database.js` to `src/database/database.js.backup`
- Updated App.tsx to remove SQLite initialization
- All database operations now use Supabase only
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED

### 3. Image Picker Functionality
**Issue**: Image picker was commented out in ProductManagementScreen
**Fix**:
- Uncommented `ImagePicker` import
- Implemented proper `handlePickImage` function with options
- Added error handling and user feedback
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED

### 4. Storage Bucket Setup
**Issue**: `product-images` storage bucket doesn't exist in Supabase
**Fix**:
- Created `STORAGE_SETUP.md` with manual setup instructions
- Created `setup-supabase-storage.js` script (failed due to RLS policies)
- **Status**: ⚠️ MANUAL SETUP REQUIRED

## 📋 Manual Setup Required

### Storage Bucket Creation
Follow the instructions in `STORAGE_SETUP.md`:

1. Go to Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to Storage section
3. Create bucket named `product-images`
4. Set as public bucket
5. Configure file size and MIME type limits

## 🔄 Remaining Issues

### 5. Barcode Scanning
**Issue**: Camera scanning is temporarily disabled, only manual entry works
**Status**: ⚠️ NOT FIXED - Requires camera permissions and barcode scanning library

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `STORAGE_SETUP.md` - Manual storage setup guide
- `DATABASE_MIGRATION.md` - Database migration strategy
- `ISSUES_FIXED.md` - This summary document
- `setup-supabase-storage.js` - Storage setup script

### Modified Files:
- `App.tsx` - Removed SQLite dependencies and migration warning
- `src/screens/ProductManagementScreen.js` - Enabled image picker
- `package.json` - Removed react-native-sqlite-storage

### Backed Up Files:

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

After completing the manual storage setup:

1. **Test Authentication**:
   ```bash
   # Run the app and test signup/login
   npx react-native run-android
   ```

2. **Test Product Management**:
   - Add products with images
   - Edit product details
   - Delete products

3. **Test Sales Tracking**:
   - Record sales transactions
   - View sales history

4. **Test Image Upload**:
   - Upload product images
   - Verify images are stored in Supabase

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Complete Storage Setup**: Follow `STORAGE_SETUP.md`
2. **Test All Functionality**: Verify everything works after migration
3. **Implement Barcode Scanning**: Add camera-based barcode scanning
4. **Performance Optimization**: Monitor app performance with Supabase-only approach
